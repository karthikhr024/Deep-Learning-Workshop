Deep Learning Workshop

Requirements:

•	Python 2.7 is the required version of Python for these classes.
•	Python libraries required: IPython notebook, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Keras, sklearn.

==> If you have an existing Python 2.7 installation:
•	pip (should be installed on recent Python distributions) - Installation instructions.
•	IPython notebook - pip install jupyter - Installation instructions
•	Numpy: pip install numpy - Installation instructions
•	Matplotlib: easy_install matplotlib(Windows) or pip install matplotlib(MacOS) - Installation instructions
•	Pandas: pip install pandas - Installation instructions
•	Keras:
•	Sklearn:
==> If you don't have any Python 2.7 installation:
Follow either one of the following bullets. The first bullet provides a minimal installation of Python, allowing you to control your Python installation. The second bullet installs Python Anaconda, a fully-featured Python installation for scientific computing.
•	Python Installation Instructions
o	Once installed, add C:\Python27 and C:\Python27\Scripts to your %PATH.
o	Follow the steps in '==> If you have an existing Python 2.7 installation'.
•	Python Anaconda (fully-featured Python installation for scientific computing): Installation instructions - Choose the Python 2.7 installation.
o	Ipython notebook: conda install jupyter
	Windows: cd C:\Anaconda\Scripts and pip install boto3
	MacOS X: cd ~/anaconda/scripts && pip install boto3
Download class materials
•	From Git:
o	git: Installation instructions
o	git clone https://github.com/nhanteh/Deep-Learning-Workshop
Run IPython Notebook
Anaconda distribution:
•	Copy the IPython Notebook launcher from the menu to the desktop.
•	Right click on the new launcher and change the Start in field by pasting the full path of the folder which will contain all the notebooks: /path/to/python_classes.
•	Double-click on the IPython Notebook desktop launcher (icon shows [IPy]) to start the Jupyter Notebook App.
Command line:
•	cd /path/to/python_classes
•	ipython notebook (ipython/jupyter has to be in your PATH)
